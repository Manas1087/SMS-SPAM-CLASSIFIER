This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The model is built using [mention your technology or library used, e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch] and trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages.

Installation
To run the SMS Spam Classifier locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Manas1087/sms-spam-classifier.git
cd sms-spam-classifier
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To classify SMS messages using the trained model, you can use the provided scripts or integrate the classifier into your own application:

python
Copy code
# Example usage
from sms_classifier import SMSClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = SMSClassifier()

# Load the trained model
classifier.load_model('path/to/saved/model')

# Predict whether a message is spam or ham
message = "Your free ringtone is waiting to be collected. Simply text the password..."
prediction = classifier.predict(message)

if prediction == 'spam':
    print(f"The message '{message}' is spam.")
else:
    print(f"The message '{message}' is not spam (ham).")
Dataset
The SMS Spam Classifier was trained on the [name of dataset, e.g., "SMS Spam Collection Dataset"] dataset, which contains labeled SMS messages.
